# Sudoku
Auto-complete sudoku games.

In this repo there is two python projects.
1. Check if a matrix in in fact a sudoku solution.
2. Auto-complete a Sudoku game.

Improvements:</br>
This challange was made months ago, while in learning process of many python concepts.</br>
There is a lot to improve and change to make the auto-complete faster and achieve cleaner code, however I am not making any modifications by now, since it shows the learning path on wich I've been.</br>

Hope you enjoy, I sure did!
